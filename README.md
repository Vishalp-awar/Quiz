#Project Title: Microservices-Based Quiz and Question Management System

Description:

This project implements a robust backend system using Spring Boot and a microservice architecture, designed to handle a quiz application with two primary microservices: Quiz Service and Question Service.

Key Features:

Quiz Service: This microservice is responsible for managing quizzes, including functionalities to create and retrieve quizzes. It allows users to easily access and manage their quizzes in a seamless manner.

Question Service: This microservice focuses on managing questions associated with quizzes. Users can add, retrieve, and manage questions efficiently, ensuring a smooth experience in quiz creation.

Service Registry: Utilizing Eureka for service registration and discovery, this project ensures that all microservices can dynamically find and communicate with one another, promoting high availability and scalability.

Load Balancing: The integration of load balancers enhances the distribution of incoming requests across multiple instances of the microservices, ensuring optimal resource utilization and improved response times.

Inter-Service Communication: OpenFeign is employed for simplifying HTTP communication between the microservices, allowing for declarative REST client calls. This streamlines interactions between the Quiz and Question Services, improving maintainability and readability of the code.

API Gateway: The project utilizes a gateway to route requests to the appropriate microservices. This acts as a single entry point for all client requests, providing a unified interface while also enhancing security and performance.

Testing and Validation: The functionalities of both microservices have been thoroughly tested using Postman, ensuring that all endpoints are functioning as expected and delivering the correct data.

Conclusion: This microservice-based architecture not only facilitates efficient handling of quizzes and questions but also provides scalability and resilience in a distributed system. By leveraging technologies such as Spring Cloud, Eureka, Load Balancer, OpenFeign, and API Gateway, the project exemplifies modern practices in building cloud-native applications.
